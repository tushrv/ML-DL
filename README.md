# Neural Networks from Scratch: A Learning Journey

## Overview

This repository serves as a personal learning resource and refresher guide for building neural networks from scratch. It contains Jupyter notebooks that document the step-by-step process of creating neural network components using only Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of neural networks by implementing each component from the ground up. This approach allows for a thorough exploration of the underlying principles and mathematics behind neural networks.

## Contents

The repository includes Jupyter notebook covering the following topics:

1. Basic Neuron
2. Neural Network Architecture
3. Activation Functions
4. Forward Pass
5. Backpropagation
6. Loss Functions
7. Optimization Techniques

## Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language
- NumPy: For efficient numerical computations
- Matplotlib: For data visualization and graphing

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, along with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
3. Open the notebooks in order, starting with the basic neuron implementation.
4. Read through the explanations, run the code cells, and experiment with the implementations.
